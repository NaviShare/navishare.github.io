We are creating next generation mobility technology for folks who are blind or visually impaired.  Our key design principles are:
* Building in collaboration with the community.
* Creating an open platform where folks can map the world to make it a more accessible place.
* Emphasizing inexpensive and robust technologies.

A get directions button shows up in the middle.  Right: Our smartphone controller for operating VoiceOver remotely.
